## Why React

* Light-weight front-end framework
  * Writing JavaScript
* Component-Based Architecture
  * Community Driven Components
* Community
* Declarative
  * Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
* Error Handling
  * Incredibly user friendly warning/error messaging

## Today's App

[OMDB App](https://blackstc.github.io/intro-react-redux-omdb/)

---

## Create-React-App
* Facebook's react generator tool
  * [Github Url](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* Great tool for getting a react app started quickly
* Javascript Fatigue
* Webpack & Babel

----

### Webpack

* Webpack is a module bundler
* Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules
* Goals of Webpack
  * Split the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
  * Keep initial loading time low
  * Every static asset should be able to be a module
  * Ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries as modules
  * Ability to customize nearly every part of the module bundler
  * Suited for big projects

----

### Babel

  * Babel is JavaScript compiler
  * Gives the ability to use next gen JavaScript functionality, without worrying about your code working on older browsers

---

## Lets Look at Some Code

---

## Homework
* Add a node backend to the react app
* Add a new API endpoint for our app to fetch movie data
